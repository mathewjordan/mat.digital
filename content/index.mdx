## About

I’m a designer and developer at Northwestern University, building open-source tools for digital humanities, collections, and scholarship—focused on crafting experiences that are bold, simple, and human. When not ruminating in the office, I’m likely avoiding technology; hands in the dirt; feet on a trail; a book in one hand, a spatula in the other; or trying, always, to be a better partner and parent.

## Work

As part of an outstanding team at Northwestern University Libraries, I have
had the privilege to contribute towards various open-source and institutional
projects. Before Northwestern, I delivered solutions on projects at the
University of Tennessee Libraries as well as Duke, NC State, Wake Forest, Butler, SUNY Albany, and more.

I am open to collaboration on projects that are focused within the realms of
digital humanities, collections, and scholarship. If you are interested in
working together, please do not hesitate to [contact
me](mailto:mat@northwestern.edu).
