Howdy, I'm Mat Jordan.

I'm a designer and developer from Asheville, North Carolina,
United States, and work for Northwestern University where I contribute to open-source
software that enhance digital collections and scholarship. My primary focus as a creator is to
build digital experiences that are bold, simple, and human. When not ruminating in the office,
I am likely to be found avoiding technology, tending my garden, backpacking the Blue
Ridge Mountains, cooking, reading, and learning to become the
best partner and parent that I can be.

## Work

As part of an outstanding team at Northwestern University Libraries, I have
had the privilege to contribute towards various open-source and institutional
projects. Before Northwestern, I delivered solutions on projects at the
University of Tennessee Libraries as well as Duke, NC State, Wake Forest, Butler, SUNY Albany, and more.

I am open to collaboration on projects that are focused within the realms of
digital collections, humanities, and scholarship. If you are interested in
working together, please do not hesitate to [contact
me](mailto:mat@northwestern.edu).
